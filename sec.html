            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base ">While spyware has historically been known for slowing down computers, the slowdown effect is harder to notice as computers and mobile devices get more powerful.

              Other signs that could indicate a device has been infected by spyware include the following:
              
              "There are several signs that a device may have been compromised by malware. One is if it is running unusually slow or lagging while performing specific activities. Another is if the browser's homepage has been changed or new browser extensions have been installed without the user's action. Additionally, if antispyware and antimalware programs are not functioning correctly, it could be a sign of malware. Another red flag is if the device is making connections to known malicious servers. Finally, if the camera or microphone on the device is turning on without the user's action, it could indicate the presence of malware."

          <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base ">"Spyware infection can have serious consequences for individuals and organizations. One of the most significant risks is the loss of personal information, which can be used for identity theft and other nefarious purposes. Spyware can also lead to decreased device performance, as it can consume resources and slow down the system. In some cases, spyware can even lead to ransomware attacks, where the victim is locked out of their own system and demanded to pay a ransom in order to regain access. It is important to be vigilant and take steps to protect yourself against spyware infection to avoid these and other negative consequences."
